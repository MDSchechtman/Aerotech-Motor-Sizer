Background
====================

When endeavoring to select the proper motor, one must consider several properties of each motor. 
These properties include, but are not limited to, the motor’s resistance, inductance, torque, 
and operating temperatures.  How these properties interact with each other must also be considered.  
For example, if a particular motor produces a torque, it will begin to raise the ambient temperature 
around it.  In some situations, this excess heat can be damaging to  equipment and needs to be 
minimized by adjusting other properties of the motor.  Due to the number of properties and ways in 
which they interact, choosing the correct motor for a particular operation is no simple task.
